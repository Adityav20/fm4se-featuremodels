# Feature Model analysis using limboole

This is a basic template to get started implementing feature model analysis via a translation from a simple FM language to propositional logic formulas in the syntax of Limboole.

As part of the assignment you will need to implement the TODOs in [FeatureModelTranslator](src/main/java/de/buw/fm4se/featuremodels/FeatureModelTranslator.java) and [FeatureModelAnalyzer](src/main/java/de/buw/fm4se/featuremodels/FeatureModelAnalyzer.java).

Some very basic test cases exist.
